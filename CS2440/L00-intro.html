						### Programming &ne; Problem Solving
						- Both are valuable skills, but they are not the same!
						- "*Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes*," attributed to Dijkstra
						- Just as being *fluent in English* does not make one a great *writer*

					<h3>Assignments & Grades</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Lab Material (30%):</strong></li>
						<ul class="small">
							<li>These will be submitted to Web-CAT, and <em>you may submit as many times as you'd like</em> to earn the grade you want.</li>
							<li>When Web-CAT assignments close, they cannot be re-opened, so no late work can be accepted. <em>No exceptions are able to be made</em>.</li>
							<li>Keep in mind that Web-CAT will only record your last grade, <em>not your best grade</em>. Consider keeping a backup of your best submission.</li>

						### Academic Integrity
						- Do not *cheat*, *copy*, or *plagiarize*
						- You may consult online resources, but you should not be searching for specific solutions
							- Do not post problems online
							- *All submitted work is expected to be your own*
						- If you are determined to have plagiarized or cheated, *you will receive an F for the course*
						---
						### Academic Integrity
						- Collaboration is *encouraged*, but all submitted work should be your own!
						- **Do**
							- discuss problems with other students
							- reinforce course material by studying together
						- **Don't**
							- copy solutions from others
							- share solutions with others
							- submit *anything you find online* as your own work
