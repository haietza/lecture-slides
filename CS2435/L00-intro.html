						### Programming &ne; Problem Solving
						- Both are valuable skills, but they are not the same!
						- "*Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes*," attributed to Dijkstra
						- Just as being *fluent in English* does not make one a great *writer*

						### Academic Integrity
						- Do not *cheat*, *copy*, or *plagiarize*
						- You may consult online resources, but you should not be searching for specific solutions
							- Do not post problems online
							- *All submitted work is expected to be your own*
						- If you are determined to have plagiarized or cheated, *you will receive an F for the course*
						---
						### Academic Integrity
						- Collaboration is *encouraged*, but all submitted work should be your own!
						- **Do**
							- discuss problems with other students
							- reinforce course material by studying together
						- **Don't**
							- copy solutions from others
							- share solutions with others
							- submit *anything you find online* as your own work

						### How to Succeed in CS2435
						- *Attend class* and *participate enthusiastically*
						- *Study* and *reinforce* the material through repetition
							- (Attempt practice problems found in handouts!)
						- *Review* previous material before the next lecture
						- Start working on assignments *early* to finish *early*!

						### Why Python?
						- Python has several features that make it ideal!
							- It is a *general-purpose* language
							- It is an *expressive*, *high-level*, *interpreted* language
							- Extensive *third-party libraries*, easy to install
							- Easy to *read*, *write*, and *understand*

						### Types of Knowledge
						- **Declarative knowledge** involves statements of fact
							- $y = \sqrt{x} \iff y \times y = x$
						- **Imperative knowledge** involves a recipe or process
						---
						### Types of Knowledge
						- **Declarative knowledge** involves statements of fact
							- A *chocolate chip cookie* is a baked biscuit usually made primarily of flour, egg, butter, and sugar
						- **Imperative knowledge** involves a recipe or process
							- Heat oven to 375&deg;F
							- Mix sugars, butter, vanilla and egg in large bowl. Stir in flour, baking soda and salt
							- Drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls about 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheet
							- Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until light brown
						---
						### Types of Knowledge
						- **Declarative knowledge** involves statements of fact
							- $y = \sqrt{x} \iff y \times y = x$
						- **Imperative knowledge** involves a recipe or process
							- How to compute $\sqrt{x}$
								- Start with a guess $y_0$ for $\sqrt{x}$ (perhaps $y_0 = 1$)
								- If $y_i \times y_i$ is close enough to $x$, stop
								- Update guess $y_{i+1} = \dfrac{y_i + \frac{x}{y_i}}{2}$ and repeat

						### What is a Recipe?
						- A *recipe* is
							- a *repeatable* sequence of *control steps*
							- managing the flow of *input* to produce an *output*
							- having a clearly-defined *stopping point*
						- An *algorithm* is just a recipe to solve a computational problem
						- A *program* is just a realization of an algorithm that can be run by a computer
					</textarea>

						### Programming
						- How do we capture a "recipe" in a mechanical process?
						- Programming languages give us a set of rich primitive operations to construct programs
						- "*If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe*" - Carl Sagan
						---
						### Programming
						- Many languages are interchangeable (see *Alan Turing*), but it is the quality of the primitives that separates them
							- powerful, low-level *assembly languages*
							- balanced, middle-level languages like *C*
							- expressive, high-level languages like *Python*
						---
						### Programming
						- When things go wrong
							- **Syntactic errors**: common and very easy to solve
							- **Semantic errors**: some languages detect these before a program can run, some do not
							- **Logical errors**: difficult to solve
								- Program *crashes*
								- Program never *terminates*
								- Program gives *unexpected answer*
						---
						### Programming
						- We aren't limited to *primitive operations* (thankfully)
							- Computers have *built-in* primitive operations
							- Programming languages provide more *expressive* abstractions of those primatives
							- *Third-party libraries* expand the pool of available operations even further!
							- Your programs provide further *abstractions*
