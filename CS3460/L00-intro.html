							- *Elementary data structures* (such as arrays, linked lists, queues, and stacks)
							- *Fundamental algorithmic processes* such as searching, selection, and sorting
							- *Algorithmic analysis* using tools such as asymptotic notation, recurrence relations, and proof techniques
						---
						### Course Overview
						- Together, we will learn
							- Important data structures such as *hash tables, priority queues, and binary search trees*, including implementation and applications
							- *Useful graph algorithms* to traverse a graph and compute a shortest path

						### Why Study Data Structures?
						Data structures are at the core of *every part* of computing!

						*Operating systems, compiler design, programming languages, networking, databases, graphics, and more!*
						---
						### Why Study Data Structures?
						All of the easy problems are *solved*! Every field is making use of *data science* to solve their hard problems

						*Science, engineering, finance, arts and humanities, commerce, health and wellness*

						Learning to write *efficient* solutions is crucially important -- efficiency is everything!
						---
						### Why Study Data Structures?
						Developing proficiency with data structures and algorithm design are one of the key things that separate a *computer scientist* from a *programmer*.
						---
						### Why Study Data Structures?
						Algorithms and data structures, above all else, are *fun*!
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Why Talk About Algorithm Design?
						An *algorithm* is a step-by-step process to solve a computational problem; a *data structure* is a tool used to store, organize, update, and retrieve data
						
						You cannot talk about one without the other!

						### Programming &ne; Algorithm Design
						- Both are valuable skills, but they are not the same!
						- "*Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes*," attributed to Dijkstra
						- Programming and software engineering proficiency are important to the success of most programming projects and careers
						- Problem-solving skills and programming skills are not the same, *but they do reinforce each other*!

						### Course Details
						- **Prerequisites**
							- CS 2440, and Java programming experience
							- A willingness to *ask questions* and *get involved*!
						- **Attendance**
							- Attendance is *mandatory*.
							- Students are permitted to miss up to five (5) lecture meetings without penalty. Each absence beyond that will result in <em>a loss of a letter grade</em>.

						### Assignments & Grades
						- **Assignments (50%):** Programming exercises that reinforce understanding of course material
						- **Midterm (25%):** Programming exam conducted online, two or more problems
						- **Final Exam (25%):** Programming exam conducted online, two or more problems
						---
						### Assignments & Grades
						- *Course is not graded on an absolute scale*. Letter grade distribution will be decided post-hoc based on final numeric grades

				<section class="left" data-markdown data-auto-animate>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Programming Assignments
						- *Problem descriptions* will include background information and some implementation details
						- Assignments will use *Java*. Your programs must be able to run on the student server, which is a *Linux environment*
						- If you do your work anywhere else, be sure to test it on the student server before submitting
						---
						### Programming Assignments
						- Programs will be graded via the following criteria:
							1. *Effort* (2 points)
							2. *Compilation, execution, and termination* (2 points)
							3. *Correctness and efficiency* (remaining points)
						- Each step of the grading process depends on it passing the previous one
						---
						### Programming Assignments
						- **Late Policy:** Work will be accepted up to 24 hours late. Any work submitted after the deadline will receive a maximum score of *70%*
						- Points may be deducted for producing *extraneous output* or not following *submission instructions*

					<textarea data-template>
						### Academic Integrity
						- Do not *cheat*, *copy*, or *plagiarize*
						- You may consult online resources, but you should not be searching for specific solutions
							- Do not post problems online
							- *All submitted work is expected to be your own*
						- If you are determined to have plagiarized or cheated, *you will receive an F for the course*
						---
						### Academic Integrity
						- Collaboration is *encouraged*, but all submitted work should be your own!
						- **Do**
							- discuss problems with other students
							- reinforce course material by studying together
						- **Don't**
							- copy solutions from others
							- share solutions with others
							- submit *anything you find online* as your own work

						### How to Succeed in CS3460
						- *Attend class* and *participate enthusiastically*
						- *Study* and *reinforce* the material through repetition
						- *Review* previous material before the next lecture
						- Start working on assignments *early* to finish *early*!

						### A Good Algorithm (or Data Structure)
						- Always terminates and produces a *"correct"* output
							- Some algorithms give an answer that is *close enough*
							- Some randomized algorithms *fail*, but with *vanishingly small probability*
						---
						### A Good Algorithm (or Data Structure)
						- Makes *efficient use of resources*
							- Usually we focus on *runtime* (time is our most precious resource!)
							- Sometimes we care about *memory usage*, *processor allocation*, *power consumption*, or the use of other shared resources
						---
						### A Good Algorithm (or Data Structure)
						- Is usually *simple*! The optimal solution is often
							- *elegant*
							- *easy to explain*
							- simple to *analyze*
							- simple to *implement*, *test*, and *debug*
