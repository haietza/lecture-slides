						### Models of Computation
						- What are the *primitive operations* available to our algorithm?
						- How realistic should this model be?
						---
						### Turing Machine
						- A Turing machine is a model defined by an *infinite length tape* containing input, a *head* that can read from or write to whichever cell of the input tape it is located above, and a *state register* to track the current state
						---
						### Random Access Machine (RAM)
						- In the RAM model, instructions are executed *sequentially*.
						- Memory is an array of words, any individual memory location accessible in *constant time*.
						- Arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder, and comparison are all constant time operations.
						---
						### Random Access Machine (RAM)
						- Is this a realistic model of computation?
						---
						### Random Access Machine (RAM)
						- In the real world, *memory access* takes substantially longer than *arithmetic operations*
						- Does not take *caching* into consideration
						---
						### Comparison Model
						- Only allowed to make *pairwise comparisons*
						- Data is a "*black box*," and defines its own *comparison operations*
						- Why choose such a restrictive model?
							- RAM model seems much more powerful!

						### Abstraction in Expressing Algorithms
						- **Example:** Given a sorted array of $n$ integers, does there exist two integers that add to a target value $t$?
						
						Notes:
						point out binary search does not need to be re-explained

						### Abstraction in Expressing Algorithms

						Notes:
						what data structure do we use to store unmatched men?
						more efficient for women to store preference lists keyed on man id rather than an ordered list
